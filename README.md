# Predict-Home-Prices-with-Python-and-Linear-Regression
1. **Project Background**

This was one of my first machine learning projects, where I worked on predicting house prices based on their size using Linear Regression. The goal was to build a simple but functional model that can estimate property prices just from the square footage. It’s a basic idea, but it helped me understand the core ML workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation.

2. **Executive Summary**

This project uses **Linear Regression** to estimate home prices based on square footage. The implementation is clean and designed to demonstrate foundational machine learning skills relevant to entry-level data roles.

3. **Data Overview**

The dataset contains two numeric columns:

- **HouseSize** – the size of the house in square feet.
- **HousePrice** – the corresponding price of the house.

4. **Model Development & Performance**

A simple Linear Regression model was trained. The data was split into training and testing sets using **train_test_split**, and the model was fitted using **LinearRegression()** from **scikit-learn.**

5. **Price Prediction Trends**

There was a clear positive linear trend: as house size increases, so does the predicted price. This confirms that the model is correctly capturing the underlying pattern.

6. **Feature Impact Analysis**

Since this model used only one feature (HouseSize), its impact was directly visible and easy to interpret. The model’s coefficient highlighted the price added per square foot.

7. **Visualization Insights**

The notebook uses a **scatter plot** to show the actual data and a **regression line** to indicate predictions. This helped visually confirm model performance.

8. **Real-World Application Use-Cases**

- Initial price estimations for online real estate platforms
- Teaching tool for new data science students learning regression

9. **Recommendations**

- Include more features such as location, number of bedrooms, year built, etc.
- Perform outlier analysis to refine model predictions
