# Predict-Home-Prices-with-Python-and-Linear-Regression
Machine learning is a major field that lets computers take in data and learn patterns to make predictions and decisions. We used Python to learn about one of the fundamentals of predictive modeling in machine learning and, more specifically, linear regression. 

We used following Python libraries for data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning:

ðŸ”¢ NumPy offers a robust foundation for numerical operations and data analysis.
ðŸ“– Pandas lets you to analyze, clean, explore, and manipulate data from different sources.
ðŸ“ˆ Matplotlib transforms your data into compelling visuals like 2D graphs and bar charts.
ðŸ¤– Scikit-learn, commonly known as Sklearn, provides a user-friendly interface for all kinds of machine learning.
